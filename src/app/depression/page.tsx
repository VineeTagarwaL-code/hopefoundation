            Depression: An Overview
          </h1>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-5">
            Depression is the most common mental disorder. As per WHO reports,
            it is the leading cause of disability worldwide and is a major
            contributor to the overall global burden of disease. Even though one
            understands depression as mood fluctuations and short-lived
            emotional responses to challenges in everyday life, it is imperative
            to treat depression if it persists for a long time, as it becomes a
            root cause for many other medical conditions if not treated on time.

            Depending on the severity of symptoms, depression can be categorized

            suffer from anxiety symptoms, loss of appetite, disturbed sleep, low

                Thereâ€™s no single test that can be used for depression
                diagnosis, but your doctor can check your symptoms and order a
                psychological evaluation. Usually, they will enquire about your
                sleeping patterns, moods, appetite, activity levels and general
                thoughts. All these analyses will help the doctor to tailor a
                suitable treatment plan. As depression can lead to other health
                problems, physical examination and blood tests may also be
                performed.

                Mild to severe, all types of depressions are treatable. If
                depression is keeping you or your loved ones away from living a
                content life then do not hesitate to seek medical help. From
                medications to therapies to lifestyle changes, there are many
                different treatment options available. Apart from therapies, or
                treatments, sometimes antidepressants, anti-anxiety and
                anti-psychotic medications are prescribed as well to treat
                depression and its symptoms. <br />
                <br /> Different people show different types of symptoms and can
                have different types of clinical depressions. The treatment
                plans also vary from person to person. Before choosing your
                doctor or opting for a treatment or therapy, it is strongly
                recommended to learn as much as you can about your depression.{" "}

              Rehabilitation for Depression
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-3">
              An effective depression treatment works on patients who are
              diagnosed with clinical depression or manic depressive psychosis.
              Depression does not affect an individual at a standard age, it is
              episodic and can affect a person in their early twenties or late
              forties, male or female, this disease can affect anyone. When you
              get help from a reputed depression help center, you can prevent
              disastrous consequences like suicide. Many people silently suffer
              from depression, even though there are various helpful channels
              like a depression treatment center, which will provide you with
              the treatment you need. <br />
              <br />
              Medical professionals at the best treatment centers for depression
              offer plans that suggest lifestyle changes, medication, or
              therapy. The treatment plan you choose will help you get on the
              right path to feeling like yourself again. If you or any of your
              loved ones are depressed or at risk of some kind of self-harm,
              then you may have to get them admitted at a rehab center, as soon
              as possible. As mentioned before, look for the symptoms and if
              more than one match then you have to contact a depression
              treatment center. Early diagnosis and depression treatment can
              prevent the disease from getting worse. <br />
              <br />
              There is no generic depression treatment that works for everyone.
              Each patient will have a different treatment style, it will depend
              on the severity of their condition. Some people will need just
              medicines, while others will need a combination of medicines and
              cognitive behavioral therapy. <br />
              <br />
              In the case of depression which is compounded with alcoholism and
              drug abuse and where outpatient therapy has failed to produce the
              desired effects, a depression rehabilitation centre is the best
              place for recovery. Rehabilitation for depression is a therapeutic
              approach that helps a patient beyond mere symptom recovery. It
              helps the person not only overcome the condition but also to
              develop their full potential by giving them the right tools and
              coping strategies to deal with their issues. Rehabilitation for
              depression offers different programs and therapies that can
              address both your mental illness and addiction.

            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              Postpartum depression occurs in women soon after giving birth. It
              is a very common condition found in women, which include symptoms
              like sadness and hopelessness after their pregnancy term. If the
              condition doesnâ€™t fade after two weeks, then do seek medical help.
              Counselling and antidepressants can help treat the condition.

              What about depression later in life?
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              Late-life depression, often known as LLD, is a type of depression
              that usually occurs after the age of 60 years. It is also known as
              Late-onset depression (LOD). As this is common in the elderly,
              there is a risk of conditions like stroke, hypertension, atrial
              fibrillation, diabetes, cancer, dementia, and chronic pain to
              further increase the risk of depression.
            </p>
            <p className="text-2xl  text-[#d47f22] mt-3">
              Why is depression more prevalent in women than in men?
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              The prevalence of major depression is higher in women than in men.
              Several risk factors are said to account for gender differences in
              rates of depression. Most common causes are hormonal differences
              between men and women. Hormones like estrogen and progesterone
              tend to affect the neurotransmitter, neuroendocrine, and circadian
              systems which ultimately triggers mood disorders.
