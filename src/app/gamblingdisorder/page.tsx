              Problem Gambling Explained
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-5">
              Of all the behavioural addictions – indeed, all addictions
              generally – that might afflict a person, there is little doubt
              that the one with the potential to cause the greatest financial
              damage, over the shortest time, is gambling. Known since ancient
              times to be capable of bringing even the very richest person down
              into complete destitution, the perils of gambling are hardly an
              unknown phenomenon; it is only comparatively recently, however,
              that gambling addiction has come to be studied and treated as a
              distinct disorder, rather than simply dismissed as an unfortunate
              vice to which only the weak and foolish succumb.
              <br />
              <br />
              Perhaps it may be said that these developments are “better late
              than never”, considering the remarkable proliferation of gambling
              outlets on Britain’s streets, and the explosion of online betting
              which now means that anyone with a phone and the appropriate apps
              is only ever a few finger-swipes away from placing bets which
              could lead to ruin. Unlike substance abuse, where an addict’s
              intake is limited by physiology and their body’s ability to cope
              with a given quantity of drink or drugs – with death potentially
              resulting from excessive consumption – the only factor limiting a
              gambler’s potential outlay, and thus potential losses, is how much
              money they can access: extremely quickly, no matter how wealthy
              they may be to begin with, a person can lose everything they own –
              including their family home.
              <br />
              <br />
              ​ Although definitions differ from one authority to another,
              gambling addiction is typically fundamentally considered to be an
              impulse control disorder manifesting in a compulsion to gamble
              (whether in one specific form – for example, betting on horses, or
              playing slot machines – or several, even many, different ones)
              regardless of the negative consequences (to oneself and/or others)
              of doing so, and perhaps despite the desire to stop.
              <br />
              <br />​ Although in order to be diagnosed as having a “gambling
              disorder” according to the DSM-V a patient needs to display
              certain symptoms within a given period , and although other
              diagnosing authorities may have their own conditions requiring to
              be met, because our understanding of behavioural addiction
              continues to evolve and because it may manifest itself in very
              different ways from one person to another, many doctors may
              consider a patient to be suffering from a gambling addiction even
              if they do not meet such strict criteria. Fundamentally, if
              someone is gambling regardless of the harm being caused to
              themselves or others, and finding it difficult or impossible to
              stop gambling, they may need treatment for their condition.

              Other Names for Gambling Addiction
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-5">
              Various terms are used to describe the condition of gambling
              addiction; it is common to hear about “problem gambling” (which
              seems to suggest slightly less entrenched behaviour, and by being
              less “medical” in nature can have the effect of downplaying the
              problem) or “compulsive gambling”, while “ludomania” (from the
              Latin words for “game” and “madness”) is a term which has
              traditionally been used by doctors without necessarily
              representing a formally agreed set of diagnostic criteria.
              “Pathological gambling” and “gambling disorder” may be diagnosed,
              as noted above, when various criteria are met (though again
              different authorities may use different criteria).
              <br />
              <br />
              Although less likely to found in a clinical setting, a large
              number of synonyms for “gambling” may also be encountered, such as
              betting, wagering and others; “betting” in particular is widely
              used, and terms such as “problem betting” can be considered
              interchangeable with any of the terms mentioned previously.
              Because “betting” does not have the stigma associated with the
              word “gambling” – even though they are effectively synonymous –
              gambling companies and bookmakers are much more likely to use
              “betting” in their advertisements and in any material they may
              produce relating to problem gambling.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-5">
              Although this is not the case every society, here in the UK
              gambling has traditionally been considered a comparatively harmful
              vice, and betting (led by the horseracing industry) has been
              legalised and regulated for many years. Anyone over the age of 18
              can go to the bookmakers, walk into a casino or gamble online
              perfectly legally; this has given rise to a situation where we are
              now surrounded – not just on the High Street, but on television
              and even in the devices we carry around constantly everyday – by
              opportunities to bet (one of the biggest challenges facing
              recovering addicts).
              <br />
              <br />
              Despite the general awareness of the damage which can be caused by
              problem gambling, occasional betting itself does not necessarily
              have any stigma attached – indeed, betting on the Grand National
              especially has come to be seen almost as an annual national
              tradition – so there are none of the offputting or discouraging
              social factors associated with starting to gamble which may
              accompany, for example, taking hard drugs (even though the
              possible financial consequences can be equally cataclysmic).
              <br />
              <br />
              Gambling is associated with excitement – making otherwise
              potentially relevant events (especially sporting events) much more
              significant to you personally by making you literally invested in
              the outcome; indeed, many betting companies have traditionally
              emphasised this in their marketing material (“It means more when
              there’s money on it”). The thrill of a football match, a close
              race, or an intense boxing bout can be extreme, almost primal –
              but unless you are devoted to your team to an absurd and
              problematic degree, the result will typically mean very little in
              terms of its effect on your daily life. Even a small wager,
              however, can change that: the experience of watching even the most
              exciting football match will not give you hard cash in your
              pocket, whereas with betting you may feel all the thrills of
              spectating followed by the pleasure of having made money.
              <br />
              <br />
              Of course, not all gambling comes from watching sport, and it’s
              easy to exaggerate the relationship between the thrill of gambling
              and things such as high-profile sporting events which are intended
              to be exciting in their own right: someone may first begin to
              gamble on fruit machines in pubs, or playing cards with friends,
              and these are activities in which there is really little or no
              “thrill” beyond that of the gambling itself. However, as any
              gambling addict is likely to testify, that particular thrill can
              become much more intense – indeed, life-changing – than any sport
              you may see live or on television.
              <br />
              <br />
              Initially, people begin to gamble because of the pleasure of
              winning – it’s often been said that someone whose first couple of
              experiences of gambling lead to unpleasant losses is unlikely ever
              to develop a gambling problem going forward (though that negative
              reinforcement, unfortunately, ceases to have an effect once
              gambling has become habitual), whereas one of the worst things
              that can happen to somebody is for them to experience a couple of
              big wins at a young age – but the winning itself is only one of
              two main pleasures (and, counterintuitively, the less important of
              the two) typically produced by gambling: the other is the thrill
              of the risk, and indeed it is this sensation which is usually the
              biggest driver of addiction and the one craved by the brain of a
              gambling addict. In other words, we may start off gambling for the
              pleasure of winning, but we continue for the pleasure of gambling
              itself.

              Types of Problem Gambling
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-5">
              In principle, any kind of gambling may lead to an addiction,
              because it is the pattern of behaviour around anticipating and
              then placing a bet, and subsequently anticipating a result, which
              becomes habitual and then addictive; it is possible, though rare,
              for gambling of a non-financial type (for instance betting
              forfeits, or taking risks with one’s health and safety: Russian
              roulette may be considered an extreme example) to lead to an
              addiction.
              <br />
              <br />
              However, most gambling does involve risking money and
              understandably it is this sort of betting around which the
              gambling industry has revolved. In the UK, the most prominent –
              and damaging – types of gambling include sports betting (including
              horseracing and spread betting), and events betting (for example
              gambling on election results) with bets able to be placed either
              inside bricks-and-mortar bookmakers or online; fruit machines and
              fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs – usually within betting shops
              or casinos); casino and card games (with versions also available
              online); and lotteries and scratchcards.
              <br />
              <br />
              Although not typically described as such, certain types of
              investing for example in the stock market – may also have many
              characteristics of gambling and can lead to the emergence of
              similar behavioural patterns and problems.

              Stages of a Gambling Addiction
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-5">
              Although it is crucial to recognise that every case of addiction
              is unique, experts often divide the evolution of a gambling
              addiction into a few key stages.

            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              Especially if the first few experiences of gambling result in
              substantial wins a gambler may feel an exhilarating rush of
              success, feeling that they have discovered the secret to wealth
              and that their own skills and talents will see them triumph where
              so many have failed. This may especially be the case with forms of
              gambling such as poker or playing the markets where a degree of
              skill can be beneficial alongside pure luck. The gambler may begin
              to focus more and more on betting, to the exclusion of other
              activities, and may begin gambling ever greater amounts (possibly
              driven by such flawed thinking as the famous “gambler’s fallacy”).

            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              Losing After a few heavy losses the initial exhilaration will
              depart, and the gambler may become increasingly focused on
              recouping the money they’ve lost which may have been set aside for
              other purposes, thus having a significant impact on the gambler’s
              and relationships and may start taking ever greater risks in order
              to chase that lost money. The initial pleasure they felt may now
              disappear, with the compulsion to gamble taking over as a result
              of the impact of process addiction upon brain chemistry. They may
              begin to spend more and more time by themselves gambling, and
              relationships and work or academia may begin to suffer, along with
              their finances.

              {" "}
              After a while betting can become the focal point of the gambler’s
              life, with many of their life prospects potentially damaged or
              ruined altogether as a result of their losses and the impact of
              their addiction upon their daily life and even most treasured
              relationships. They are unable to stop gambling even with the very
              last of their money, or with sums they may have borrowed to buy
              food and other necessities. They may engage in crime,fraud, theft
              or other forms in order to fund their habit, and could possibly be
              in danger as a result of loans they may have taken out in order to
              fund gambling and repay other debts. Complete destitution is not
              by any means an impossibility, while many gamblers who have
              reached this point may engage in suicidal ideation, or even
              attempt suicide, in the face of what they see as a hopeless
              situation.

              Causes of Problem Gambling
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              Although the mechanisms through which gambling addiction – and
              behavioural addictions generally – takes hold in terms of brain
              chemistry are increasingly well (though still imperfectly)
              understood, our understanding of why those mechanisms manifest in
              some people and not others is still comparatively limited.
              <br />
              <br />
              It is generally accepted that both genetic and environmental
              factors are at play: there is a hereditary element to addiction
              which means that someone with a family history of addiction is
              themselves more likely to become an addict, but this is not
              applicable in every case; meanwhile, we are aware of a great many
              factors in someone’s upbringing and later life which are known to
              increase the risk of addiction, but again while these factors can
              be decisive in one person they may not lead to any addiction in
              another.
              <br />
              <br />
              It is clear however that the more someone is exposed to gambling
              (especially at a young age) the greater the likelihood that they
              will at least begin to gamble – and of course without starting
              gambling in the first place a gambling addiction will not
              manifest, although it is again always important to remember that
              gambling once or even many times will not automatically cause an
              addiction

              How The Brain Gets Addicted to Gambling
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              The mechanism and biology of addiction have been studied
              intensively in recent decades. Fundamentally, addiction is a
              disorder of the brain – specifically of the brain’s reward centre
              which governs one’s responses to engaging in particular activities
              and behavioural patterns and to certain external stimuli. While
              numerous biomolecular mechanisms are involved, the most prominent
              relates to the production of the chemical dopamine, which
              stimulates certain receptors in the brain (in particular in areas
              known as the amygdala and the ventral tegmental area) and creates
              the desire to repeat the behaviour (and the anticipation thereof)
              which has caused the initial dopamine production.Once a person’s
              brain has “learnt” this response to certain.

              Signs & Symptoms of Problem Gambling
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              As with any addiction, an addict may go to great lengths to
              conceal their condition, and unlike in the case of many substance
              abuse disorders there may be few if any physical signs. On the
              other hand, a very damaging gambling addiction can be just as
              catastrophic to a person’s lifestyle and wealth as any drug
              addiction – perhaps even more so as their expenditure will not be
              limited by their physical capacity for substances of abuse.
              Therefore in most serious cases a visible deterioration will be
              identifiable.

            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              The emotional strain of being a gambling addict can be profound,
              especially if and when losses are racked up which will have a
              significant impact on the life of the addict and on those around
              them, especially close family. Volatile mood swings are common and
              depression is extremely likely to manifest over time, along with a
              markedly more pessimistic outlook and demeanour. Complete
              emotional collapse is not uncommon, while bouts of tears and/or
              aggression are typical. On the other hand, in the aftermath of a
              big win, the addict is likely to be on an emotional high. Gambling
              can produce symptoms resembling those of bipolar disorder or
              mania, with all the associated risks of self-harm and/or suicide.

            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              While gambling addiction does not present physical symptoms in the
              same way as substance abuse disorders typically involve visible
              intoxication, there may well be a pronounced physical impact on
              the addict: for example, long periods without sleep and extremely
              irregular eating patterns – both of which may result from long
              binges of gambling – can cause a range of visible physical
              problems including tics, fainting, seizures, malnutrition and many
              more. Even in less extreme cases, a general deterioration of
              physical appearance may be identifiable.
              <br />
              <br />
              As and when a gambling addiction begins to have serious financial
              consequences, moreover, this is likely to become visible in the
              form of deteriorating clothing and a shabby appearance generally,
              as well as decreased levels of hygiene. It is important to note
              that gambling often co-occurs with other addictions, especially
              alcoholism, which may present their own physical symptoms.

            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              As with many addictions, problem gambling can cause very
              significant changes to a person’s behaviour and, eventually, to
              their character. Lying and secrecy typically go hand-in-hand with
              the emergence of addiction as the gambler attempts to conceal
              their habits and, especially, losses. Sleeping and eating patterns
              may change, while they may lose interest in previously treasured
              activities and people, and form new peer groups or descend into
              isolation. Depending on the specific type of gambling involved,
              they may become obsessive about data or probabilities. Work may be
              negatively affected by tardiness, absenteeism, declining
              concentration and cognitive faculties, and possibly a use of work
              facilities to gamble.
              <br />
              <br />
              They are likely constantly to be asking to borrow money, while on
              the other hand they may be occasionally extremely flush with money
              and engaging in very liberal spending. They are also very likely
              frequently to be preoccupied and taciturn, and possibly very
              depressed, adopting a very negative demeanour and potentially
              feeling animosity towards the world at large because of what they
              see as their very bad luck.

            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              As previously noted, gambling has the potential to be the most
              expensive form of addiction, with no theoretical upper limit on
              losses beyond how much money an addict can access in any way.
              Typically an addict is likely to be short of or entirely without
              cash on a frequent basis, often needing to borrow money to fund
              the basics of life. They may burn through even valuable assets
              very quickly, even those which technically are being shared with
              partners. They may be unable to obtain credit legitimately, and
              could have a history of default or bankruptcy. Some problem
              gamblers engage in financial crime to fund their habits or cover
              losses.

              young people are nevertheless at risk of developing gambling

              requesting pocket money, selling possessions and/or engaging in
              criminal activity (including stealing from parents) to fund their
              habits, increasing emotional volatility and depression,
              absenteeism from school, pronounced isolation, interrupted sleep
              patterns and a lot of interest in previously treasured hobbies and
              companions may all be indicative of the emergence of gambling
              addiction – though other causes may also be identified.

              Short-Term and Long-Term Impacts of Gambling Addiction
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              As noted, the impact of addiction can be catastrophic. Even in the
              short term, complete destitution is a very real risk – there is
              very little to prevent someone, if they so choose, from gambling
              away their life savings over the course of a few minutes in the
              bookies – while, over the long term, bearing in mind the maxim
              that “the house always wins”, financial ruin is almost an
              inevitability. The more, and the longer, one gambles, the greater
              the chance one will lose everything, Of course, some kinds of
              gambling – regional or national lotteries, most obviously – offer
              vast, life-changing prizes for a very small outlay – but even here
              there is no guarantee that such huge sums will remain intact for
              long: the overwhelming majority of big lottery winners burn
              through their winnings within a decade.
              <br />
              <br />
              The impact of a gambling addiction on a gambler’s relationships
              with others is typically extremely detrimental: even merely being
              around someone in the throes of such an addiction can be very
              distressing, so even when a gambler is not retreating into
              isolation (and potentailly depression) they may find themselves
              bereft of company, even that of hitherto treasured friends.
              Meanwhile, the financial implications for a spouse/partner of a
              gambling addict, and any children or other dependents, can be
              terrifying – especially in cases where both parties share
              ownership of important assets such as a house. History is littered
              with tales of gambling addicts who have left not just themselves
              but their families out on the street, while even short of such
              tragedy relationships can be irreparably damaged by the deceit and
              volatile behaviour which can often accompany a gambling addiction.
              <br />
              <br />
              The health consequences of problem gambling can also be permanent,
              with depression frequently leading to self-harm and suicide, and
              physical health suffering as a result of issues related to stress,
              unhealthy dietary and sleeping patterns and other factors;
              gambling addictions often co-occur with substance abuse disorders
              which of course have their own implications for physical and
              mental health. A gambler’s health and safety (and even those of
              loved ones) can also be in jeopardy if they resort to unorthodox
              funding methods such as borrowing from potentially violent loan
              sharks, and/or acts of crime.
              <br />
              <br />
              Meanwhile, less dramatically but by no means unimportantly, a
              gambler’s credit score can of course be permanently affected
              (whilst bankruptcy can have even greater implications), and their
              reputation can quickly be destroyed: once someone gains a
              reputation for being a problem gambler (or “degenerate”, in more
              judgemental terms) it can be impossible to shake it off, and many
              people are unwilling to place any trust in a gambling addict as
              they fear it may be betrayed as soon as their backs are turned.

              Co-occuring Disorders in Gambling Addiction
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              Gambling addiction frequently occurs alongside other mental health
              conditions, and indeed other addictions. The extent to which
              gambling addiction is a result of, a cause of, or simply coincides
              with, any other disorder/s (known as “comorbidity”) obviously
              varies from one individual to another, and there is no universal
              rule which states that someone with a gambling addiction will also
              certainly have any other given disorder.
              <br />
              <br />
              Typically, the most common disorders resulting (with a decent
              degree of certainty) from gambling addiction include anxiety
              disorders, depression and other mood disorders, and substance
              abuse disorders, though a huge variety of other conditions have
              also been associated with gambling addiction (for instance,
              kleptomania, perhaps initially resulting from a need to acquire
              money, but eventually becoming a clinical condition in its own
              right).
              <br />
              <br />
              It is perhaps less easy to establish causal connections between
              pre-existing conditions and gambling addiction, and again every
              case is unique, with no certainty that someone with a given
              disorder will become a gambling addict if exposed to gambling.
              However, various studies show that people with bipolar disorder
              and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as
              certain personality disorders, are significantly more likely than
              average to develop gambling addictions.

              Problem Gambling and Substance Abuse
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              For many people, problem gambling goes hand-in-hand with substance
              abuse, and is by no means unusual to find that someone with a
              gambling addiction has also developed an addiction to drink and/or
              drugs. In some ways this relation to other problems should come as
              little surprise – after all, not everyone is susceptible to
              addiction, and those who are have a disorder in the brain’s reward
              system (as discussed above) which leaves them vulnerable to
              addiction of more than one kind. Furthermore, the environments in
              which gambling takes place are often either criminal by definition
              or frequented by criminals (especially those seeking to launder
              money) thus increasing the likelihood of exposure to substances of
              abuse.
              <br />
              <br />
              Those gambling for the thrill of it, at least initially, are more
              likely than the average to crave thrills of other kinds too, with
              stimulants such as cocaine (which can also make the user feel more
              confident in their own judgement) and other euphoria-inducing
              substances especially popular; alcohol, meanwhile, is both
              ubiquitous and legal in the UK, and its disinhibitory effects mean
              those under the influence of are much more likely than normal to
              begin, or continue, gambling. Heavy gamblers may resort to
              stimulants to stay awake during prolonged bouts of gambling (for
              example at gaming tables or playing cards online).
              <br />
              <br />
              Substance abuse is often a response to depression and other
              disorders which can result from gambling (especially from heavy
              losses). the image of a gambler “drowning his/her sorrows” in a
              bottle of spirits may be a very tired cliche, but it’s no less
              accurate for that, and as gambling addiction takes hold and a
              gambler’s life circumstances deteriorate they are ever more likely
              to seek consolation in drink and drugs. Such self-medication may
              make for a pleasant short-term fix but in the long term will only
              lead to a vicious circle of deeper depression, more volatile
              behaviour, and greater desperation.

              understanding of the problem, and a rapid rise in the number and
              capability of organisations and facilities treating the condition.
              Through a combination of therapy (especially cognitive behavioural
              therapy (CBT), motivational therapy (MT) and motivational
              interviewing (MI)), medication (where appropriate to treat
              underlying conditions and complications arising from addiction),

              As with any addiction, the process of recovering from a gambling
              addiction can only begin once you are able to recognise and admit
              to your condition. When you reach that point, your first port of
              call should be your GP, who can give a preliminary assessment and
              discuss next steps with you; you may also wish to consult an
              addiction specialist, who may have a greater understanding of the
              specific challenges you face and of the treatment organisations
              and facilities which may be most appropriate for you. <br />
              <br /> While it is always recommended to seek professional help,
              you may wish to attempt to tackle your addiction independently,
              and a great variety of approaches are available: you can find a
              huge amount of information online, while numerous relevant books
              can be found on the shelves of local bookshops and libraries. Do
              be careful, however: while many good-natured people have done
              tremendous work in this field, scammers and con artists are also
              unfortunately numerous, and you should not make any investment in
              self-help material without first doing research. Again, your GP or
              an addiction specialist can discuss these approaches with you and
              perhaps give recommendations.

              important element of recovery. A treatment programme such as that
              provided at a rehab will give you various psychological mechanisms
              against relapse, as may a psychotherapist specialising in the
              treatment of addiction.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you do relapse, however, do not despair or punish yourself
              unduly for it; it is rare for someone to make it through recovery
              whilst never once having relapsed, and being overly hard on
              yourself should you do so only makes it more likely that you will
              sink back into a vicious circle. Stay calm, if possible reach back
              out to any therapists or other professionals who have helped you
              previously, and focus on a positive future rather than the
              negativity of relapse.

              Prevention for Problem Gambling
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              Prevention is better than cure, and the best way to prevent a
              gambling addiction from occurring is never to start gambling!
              However, if you have already done so you should not feel yourself
              condemned to a life spent gambling and regretting. Instead it is
              vital to avoid engaging in more problematic behaviour where
              possible.
              <br />
              <br />
              Key steps you can take include (among many others) recognising
              your triggers (and avoiding them where possible); distancing
              yourself from fellow gambling addicts; blocking yourself from
              gambling websites and apps (self-exclusion); avoiding, where
              possible, walking past bookmakers or casinos; only carrying the
              bare minimum of cash; staying away from substance abuse; and
              having a sponsor or similar individual who you can contact if you
              feel yourself in danger of relapsing.
              <br />
              <br />
              Participation in self-help groups is certainly a great help to
              many, while an addiction specialist can discuss your situation
              specifically and give advice on how to resist temptation – as well
              as sharing information on treatment options should you feel that
              you need that degree of help.

              Finding Alternatives to Gambling
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              As with any addiction, the temptation to relapse is likely to be a
              Once a person has developed an addiction, other activities can
              feel mundane, unsatisfying and pointless. However, the cost of
              engaging in addictive behaviour can be hugely destructive, as
              discussed, so finding alternative ways of spending your time is
              vital. If possible, look at activities which can improve your
              physical health, since fitness is a great platform on which to
              build a recovery. Participating in sport – as long as it does not
              prove to be a trigger – is a great way of staying fit and at the
              same time building up a peer group if you feel lonely and/or in
              need of support and company.
              <br />
              <br />
              However, once again everyone is unique and an activity which is
              enjoyable for one person may be extremely tedious – or physically
              impossible – for another. There is no need to be excessively
              prescriptive when considering alternative activities; the
              important thing is to find something you enjoy doing; that does
              not trigger you or make you think about gambling or other
              compulsive behaviours; that does not put you on the wrong side of
              the law or further alienate you from loved ones; and that does not
              prove too stressful or in other ways jeopardise your stability and
              mental health.
              <br />
              <br />
              Once again, you may wish to speak with your GP about activities
              which might be appropriate for your physical condition, and with
              an addiction specialist who may be able to suggest options based
              on his/her experience with other addicts.

    myth: " “Gambling is only a problem when you’re losing”",
    facts: `Even if a person’s gambling is not currently costing them money – or even if it is making them a profit – it can still be extremely damaging to their relationships and life prospects (especially if their attention is primarily focused upon gambling at the expense of other activities or other people, or if they’re experiencing disruptions to sleeping and eating patterns, high levels of stress and other factors associated with gambling which can have negative health consequences. Furthermore, as part of a broader pattern, intense and/or prolonged gambling almost invariably results in an overall loss, and successful periods may not be representative of an unsuccessful whole.`,
  },
  {
    myth: " “If you’re not betting every day, it’s not a problem”",
    facts: `Some gambling addicts may bet infrequently (though nevertheless the scale of those bets may be dangerous). It isn’t the frequency of the gambling that is the problem: it’s the impact upon the gambler and those around them.`,
  },
  {
    myth: "“It’s not a problem if I can afford it”",
    facts: `As mentioned above, gambling can have profound consequences in ways other than financial ones. Moreover, a person may start off making bets they can easily afford, only to increase the stakes to very problematic levels once addiction has taken hold: just because you can afford it now doesn’t mean that will always be the case.`,
  },
  {
    myth: "“Gambling addicts are criminals”",
    facts: `It is perfectly possible to suffer from a gambling addiction without ever engaging in criminal activity. Unfortunately, some people – perhaps burdened with debt or unable to hide losses from loved ones – are tempted to commit crime to raise or pay back money, but this is not an inevitable development.`,

  {
    Question: "How can problem gambling impact my life?",
    Answer: `A gambling addiction can lead to complete financial destitution and a wide range of health problems – physical and mental – which can potentially be fatal.

  },
  {
    Question: "Who is at risk of a gambling addiction?",
    Answer: `Anyone who gambles is at risk of developing addiction. The precise causes of addiction are not fully understood, but the only people not at risk of developing a gambling addiction are those who never gamble at all.`,
  },
  {
    Question: "What are the types of problem gambling?",
    Answer: `Any type of gambling can theoretically lead to an addiction. The most common forms of gambling include sports betting, events betting, fruit machines and fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs), casino and card gaming, online gambling, and lotteries and scratchcards. Playing the stock market may also be considered a form of gambling.`,
  },
  {
    Question:
      "How do I know if a friend or family member has a gambling addiction?",
    Answer: `It may be impossible to tell for sure if a loved one is suffering from a gambling addiction. However, some signs include constantly being short of money or asking to borrow money; increased isolation, mood swings and depression; an obsession with sports results; greatly altered sleeping and eating patterns; a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities; tardiness and absenteeism; a lack of care in physical appearance and hygiene; engaging in substance abuse; and frequent disappearances in order to gamble.`,
  },
  {
    Question: "How will I know if I need treatment?",
    Answer: `If you believe you have a gambling problem, or have tried repeatedly to stop gambling but have failed, you almost certainly have an addiction requiring treatment`,
  },
  {
    Question: "How do I get the best help?",
    Answer: `Speak with your GP about your situation and what options may be available to you locally; and contact an addiction specialist for more in-depth information including next steps towards rehab or other treatment.`,
  },
  {
    Question: "What will happen at the doctor’s office?",
    Answer: `Your GP will listen to you describe your situation and why you are concerned, and will conduct a health assessment. If in your GP’s eyes you are in need of treatment, they will refer you to a specialist or specialists, and will also be able to give you information on the services available to you.`,
  },
  {
    Question: "What can I do to protect my child from problem gambling?",
    Answer: `Keep your child away from any instances of gambling, including representations in the media. Children are not allowed by law to gamble and may not enter betting shops or use any online gambling services. If you, a loved one or acquaintance win money from betting, do not celebrate in your children’s company and by no means display any enthusiasm for gambling. If asked about gambling, as part of your response explain some of the negative consequences, giving real-life examples where possible.`,
