              Personality Disorder
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mt-5">
              Personality comprises the behavioural pattern, how we react, our
              views & thoughts, feelings, and our ability to understand and cope
              with a situation. A healthy personality enables a person to
              function efficiently in daily life. But what happens when we can’t
              manage our personality and end up messing up our lives and
              relationships? This condition is medically termed as a Personality
              Disorder.
              <br />
              <br />
              When an individual has a personality disorder, responding to
              changes, managing the demands of life and maintaining
              relationships become much harder. It often results in social
              isolation and depression.
              <br />
              <br />
              Psychiatrists categorize personality disorder into three groups
              depending on their symptoms – Suspicious; Emotional & impulsive;
              and Anxious. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a disorder
              of the emotional & impulsive category.
              <br />
              <br />
              Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a severe mental illness
              that revolves around the inability to manage emotions effectively.
              It is the most commonly recognized personality disorder. It
              affects the way individuals see themselves,
              <br />
              <br />
              People suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder may
              experience intense episodes of anger, depression, and anxiety as
              it is difficult for them to manage their emotions. There’s a
              constant fear of instability and abandonment, difficulty being
              alone, and severe concerns about self-image among others.
              <br />
              <br />
              These experiences of inappropriate anger, impulsiveness and
              frequent mood swings can bring in long-term patterns of unstable
              or turbulent emotions often leading to impulsivity and chaotic
              relationships with the people close to them.
              <br />
              <br />
              This disorder usually begins during adolescence or early
              adulthood. Borderline personality symptoms in adults are easy to
              manage as diagnosis and treatment are quite possible. The symptoms
              of borderline personality disorder in teens are confusing,
              frustrating, and hard for loved ones, especially for parents to
              understand. Teens with BPD lack a clear sense of self, feel
              chaotic and stressed, and eventually become isolated and
              desperate. Therefore, the treatment that should be relatively easy
              becomes extremely difficult to manage.

              <li>Self-harm and suicidal tendency or attempts</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              The reason why this mental disorder is called ‘borderline’ is
              quite historical. Earlier mental illnesses were categorised as
              ‘Psychoses’ or ‘Neuroses’. Psychosis is a severe mental illness
              characterized by loss of contact with reality, whereas Neurosis is
              a mild functional neuro-psychical disorder. When psychiatrists
              first stated about BPD, it didn’t fit into either category.
              ‘Borderline’ became the imaginary line between these two groups of
              illnesses to define the disease BPD.
              <br />
              <br />
              Theodore Millon, a renowned field expert, has distinguished BPD
              into four different types. According to him, there is no
              presumption that a person will suffer the symptoms of only one
              subtype.
              <br />
              <br />
              Discouraged borderline personality disorder – Individuals
              exhibiting this disorder often seem needy and dependent are more
              likely than other BPD sufferers to resort to self-harm as a coping
              mechanism.
              <br />
              <br />
              Impulsive borderline personality disorder – People suffering from
              this type of BPD are energetic, charismatic, and exciting to be
              around but they are easily bored and are quick to become angry or
              upset.
              <br />
              <br />
              Petulant borderline – They are often irritable and prone to
              outbursts of anger and frustration. They are also very impatient
              in nature and can quickly become delusional.
              <br />
              <br />
              Self-destructive borderline – As the name suggests, they exhibit
              self-destructive borderline symptoms and are said to be their own
              enemy.
              <br />
              <br />
              Feelings like anxiety, fear, worry, or self-loathe are a part and
              parcel of daily life. But if these feelings are consistent,
              unstable, and intense and cause significant problems in day to day
              work, it is advisable to seek medical help.

Symptoms</h1>
            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              People with BPD tend to view things in extremes, either something
              is too good or too bad. They find it difficult to regulate
              emotions. They experience major mood swings and display
              uncertainty about their role among others. Off late borderline
              personality disorder in teens is being diagnosed early helping in
              better patient outcomes. The risk of self-harm or suicidal
              behavior is also reduced, the earlier the disease is detected.

              Borderline personality disorder symptoms in males are quite

              to criticism and retaliate through strong criticism of others.
              They tend to compensate for the lack of control they experienced
              in childhood or any trauma by overly controlling their adult
              relationships. They are often misdiagnosed with other disorders as

Diagnosis</h1>
            <p className="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-500">
              In the past, Borderline Personality Disorder diagnosis and
              treatment were not available as there was no proven or effective
              remedy present, and neither there were enough treatment facilities
              for borderline personality disorder. But now Borderline
              Personality Disorder treatment and management is possible. The
              healing process in BPD is a matter of breaking the dysfunctional
              patterns of feeling, thinking, and behaving which are primarily
              caused by distress. However, BPD may require patients to take
              lifelong treatment similar to any chronic condition.
              <br />
              <br />
              Due to the difficulties in diagnosing BPD, it is often
              underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. As BPD shares common symptoms with
              several other mental illnesses, your doctor will need to rule
              these out before being able to make a BPD diagnosis. <br />A
              licensed mental health professional, such as a borderline
              personality disorder psychiatrist or psychologist can diagnose

    title: "Genetics:",
    point: `The genetic makeup that you inherit from your parents can make you vulnerable to BPD. There have been studies that show that if one twin has BPD then there are high chances that the other twin will develop symptoms of BPD as well. But, you have to treat these results with caution because no set gene carries the BPD trait.

    title: "Problem with neurotransmitters:",
    point: `Another cause for BPD is having problems with brain chemicals. It’s assumed that most people who suffer from borderline personality disorder have a dysfunction in the neurotransmitter of their brain, especially with the serotonin levels. Neurotransmitters are “messenger chemicals” that the brain utilizes to send signals between brain cells and major body organs. Fluctuating serotonin levels have been linked to depression, aggressive behavior, and having difficulty controlling destructive urges. Treatment facilities for Borderline Personality Disorder will help narrow down the cause and diagnose your illness, in a professional and skilled environment.`,

  {
    title: "Stunted brain development:",
    point: `Medical professionals have used MRI to study patients diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder. MRI scans tend to use magnetic fields and radio waves to create a detailed image inside the body. The scan revealed that patients suffering from BPD will have three parts of the brain that are either smaller than normal or have unusual activity. The parts that are affected are responsible for regulating negative emotions, self-control, planning and decision making, and behavior. Problems with these three parts can contribute towards symptoms of BPD. The development of these regions is affected during early childhood and they are responsible for mood regulation. `,
