      "description": "The addict/alcoholic has the disease of addiction, but that stresses the family to the breaking point, impacting the stability of the home, the family's unity, mental health, physical health, finances, and overall family dynamics. It affects all who live under the same roof, hence it's termed as a family disease. Living with a loved one in active addiction can put family members under unusual stress. Normal routines are constantly interrupted by unexpected or even frightening experiences. Living with an addict causes severe trauma to everyone within the home, leading to the disintegration of the family and fostering resentment."

      "description": "A person who is actively addicted can be convincing and manipulative, making it hard for family members to say no. Lies from the addict can be frequent, leading to confusion about when they are being truthful. Families often want to find solutions, but those who do not understand the difference between enabling and helping may end up contributing to the problem. Enabling occurs when the family and friends of an addict support their addiction through their behaviors and thoughts, preventing the addict from facing the consequences of their actions. This can hinder the recovery process."

      "description": "The addict/alcoholic often uses denial as a defense mechanism. A Fact Session is a meeting between the addict/alcoholic, their family, and other clients in the rehab, moderated by a counselor. This session aims to break the addict's denial by discussing the impact of their addiction on themselves and their loved ones. The session can be emotionally charged, revealing hidden issues and laying the groundwork for recovery. It's a pivotal point in the process of guiding the addict/alcoholic toward realizing their condition and the need for treatment."

Making excuses for their behavior only perpetuates the problem. Family involvement in ensuring that the addict/alcoholic attends NA/AA meetings is critical, providing a supportive community for sharing experiences and maintaining anonymity.
